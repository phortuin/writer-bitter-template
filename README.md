# iA Writer Template for Bitter font

A clean template aimed at screen readability and writing about code. Features code highlighting with [PrismJS](http://prismjs.com/).

Uses these free fonts (downloadable from Fontsquirrel):

- Bitter [Download here](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/bitter)
- Chivo [Download here](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/chivo)

Also uses Apple’s San Francisco Mono for code blocks, but falls back to Menlo which is a perfectly fine alternative.

## Install

- Open iA Writer
- Open menu _iA Writer > Preferences > Templates_
- Click the [ + ] button below _Custom templates_
- Add the `Bitter.iatemplate` package  that is in this repository

iA Writer then copies the template to its own system folder (right click the template in the _Custom templates_ picker, choose ‘Show in Finder’ to see where exactly).

## Usage

To use the template, either select it in Writer’s preferences, or via the menu _View > Templates > Bitter_
